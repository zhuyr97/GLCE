This is a implementation of our paper “ Learning Dual Transformation Networks for Image
Contrast Enhancement”and for non-commercial use only. You need to install Python with Tensorflow-GPU to run this code.

Install Tensorflow： https://www.tensorflow.org/install/


Usage:

1. Preparing training data: put low-contrast images into "/TrainData/input" and label images into "/TrainData/label". Note that the pair images' indexes **must be** the same.  Should modify the corresponding paths in the codes.

2. Run 
"training.py" for training and trained models should be generated at "/model".

3. After training, run 
"testing_grayimgs.py" to test gray images.
"testing_colorimgs.py" to test colorimages.
